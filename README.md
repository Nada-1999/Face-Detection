# Face-Detection
This project focuses on developing a real-time face detection application using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The application captures video from a webcam, detects faces in the video stream, and draws bounding boxes around the detected faces.

# Objectives:

1. Implement Real-time Face Detection: Utilize OpenCV to capture live video feed from a webcam and detect faces in real-time.
2. Use Haar Cascade Classifier: Employ the Haar Cascade Classifier provided by OpenCV to detect faces in each frame of the video stream.
3. Draw Bounding Boxes: Highlight detected faces by drawing bounding boxes around them for visual confirmation.
4. Handle Real-time Constraints: Ensure the application runs efficiently to process video frames in real-time.
